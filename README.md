```python
from adaptml import AdaptiveInference
import numpy as np

# Initialize with your models
system = AdaptiveInference()
system.register_model("small", small_model, size="small", cost_per_1k=0.10)
system.register_model("large", large_model, size="large", cost_per_1k=0.50)

# That's it! AdaptML automatically selects the right model
data = np.random.randn(1, 10)
result = system.infer(data, target_confidence=0.8)  # Uses small model if sufficient
print(f"Saved {result.cost_saved:.1f}% on this inference!")
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
from adaptml import AdaptiveInference
import numpy as np

# 1. Initialize system
ai = AdaptiveInference()

# 2. Register your models (supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
ai.register_model("fast", your_small_model, cost_per_1k=0.10)
ai.register_model("accurate", your_large_model, cost_per_1k=0.50)

# 3. Run adaptive inference
data = np.random.randn(10, 784)  # Your input data
result = ai.infer(data, target_confidence=0.9)

print(f"Model used: {result.model_name}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2f}")
print(f"Cost saved: {result.cost_saved:.1f}%")
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Confidence-Based Selection
```python
# Low confidence requirement - uses fast model
result = ai.infer(data, target_confidence=0.8)

# High confidence requirement - uses accurate model only when needed
result = ai.infer(data, target_confidence=0.95)
```

### Latency-Constrained Inference
```python
# Prioritize speed
result = ai.infer(data, max_latency_ms=50)
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple inputs efficiently
results = ai.infer_batch(batch_data, target_confidence=0.9)
```

## 📈 Performance Tracking

```python
# Get detailed statistics
stats = ai.get_stats()
print(f"Total inferences: {stats.total_inferences}")
print(f"Average cost savings: {stats.avg_cost_savings:.1f}%")
print(f"Model usage: {stats.model_usage}")
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

AdaptML works by:

1. **Model Registration** - Register multiple models with different accuracy/cost trade-offs
2. **Confidence Prediction** - Estimate confidence before running expensive models
3. **Adaptive Selection** - Choose the smallest model that meets requirements
4. **Fallback Mechanism** - Automatically escalate to larger models when needed

## 🌟 Why AdaptML?

### Traditional Approach
```python
# Always uses the largest, most expensive model
result = large_model.predict(data)  # $0.50 per 1K requests
```

### With AdaptML
```python
# Intelligently selects the right model
result = ai.infer(data, target_confidence=0.9)  # $0.25 per 1K requests (50% savings!)
```
