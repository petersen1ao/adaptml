# üöÄ ADAPTML SSO: EXECUTIVE PITCH DECK
## Self-Scaffolding Security Orchestrator

---

## üéØ THE PROBLEM: CYBERSECURITY IS BROKEN

### Current Security Systems Are:
- **REACTIVE**: Wait for attacks to happen, then respond
- **STATIC**: Rely on fixed signatures that can't adapt
- **SINGLE-MODAL**: Only analyze text, miss multimedia threats
- **MANUAL**: Require human intervention for new threats

### The Cost of Failure:
- **$10.5 TRILLION** annual cybercrime damage by 2025
- **60% of companies** go out of business within 6 months of a cyberattack
- **Zero-day attacks** increasing 50% year-over-year
- **Multi-modal attacks** evading traditional security systems

---

## üí° THE SOLUTION: SELF-SCAFFOLDING SECURITY

### AdaptML's Revolutionary Approach:
- **PROACTIVE**: Detect and stop threats before they cause damage
- **DYNAMIC**: Adapts to new attacks in real-time using QLoRA
- **MULTI-MODAL**: Analyzes text, images, audio simultaneously
- **AUTONOMOUS**: Self-generates defenses for novel threats

### The SSO Advantage:
- **80%+ Zero-Day Detection** without prior knowledge
- **Real-Time Adaptation** to emerging threats
- **Multi-Modal Coverage** across all attack vectors
- **Self-Evolving Intelligence** that improves continuously
