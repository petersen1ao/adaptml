# AdaptML Examples & Demos

This directory contains enterprise-ready examples and demonstrations of AdaptML capabilities.

## Available Demos

### 1. Basic Usage (`basic_usage.py`)
- Simple introduction to AdaptML
- Shows cost optimization setup
- Demonstrates model registration and inference
- **Run**: `python basic_usage.py`

### 2. Enterprise Demo (`enterprise_demo.py`)
- Comprehensive enterprise demonstration
- Real-world scenarios (customer support, fraud detection, etc.)
- Cost analysis and optimization results
- Performance benchmarking
- **Run**: `python enterprise_demo.py`

### 3. Quickstart Fixed (`quickstart_fixed.py`)
- Updated quickstart with proper API usage
- Batch processing examples
- System statistics and monitoring
- **Run**: `python quickstart_fixed.py`

### 4. Google Colab Notebook (`AdaptML_Enterprise_Demo.ipynb`)
- Interactive demonstration for Google Colab
- Visualization of cost savings
- Enterprise integration examples
- **Open**: Upload to Google Colab or run locally with Jupyter

## Quick Start

1. **Install AdaptML**:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/petersen1ao/adaptml.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run any demo**:
   ```bash
   cd examples
   python enterprise_demo.py
   ```

## Expected Output

All demos are designed to:
- ✅ Work without additional ML frameworks
- ✅ Show cost optimization (60-80% savings)
- ✅ Demonstrate adaptive model selection
- ✅ Provide enterprise-ready examples
- ✅ Use only ASCII characters (no encoding issues)

## Demo Features

- Enterprise integration patterns
- One-click installation and setup

## Enterprise Integration

The demos show how to:
- Set up AdaptML in production environments
- Configure cost thresholds and optimization
- Handle batch processing workloads
- Monitor system performance and costs
- Integrate with existing ML pipelines

## Contact & Support

- **Email**: info2adaptml@gmail.com
- **Website**: https://adaptml-web-showcase.lovable.app/
- **Enterprise Support**: Available for production deployments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import errors**: Ensure AdaptML is installed from GitHub
2. **Dependency issues**: Install numpy and other required packages
3. **Performance**: Demos use mock models for cross-platform compatibility

### Getting Help
- Check the main repository README
- Contact enterprise support for production issues
- Review the Google Colab notebook for interactive troubleshooting
